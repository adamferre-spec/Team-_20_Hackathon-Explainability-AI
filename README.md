# 🛡️ CyberGuard AI — HR Attrition Prediction with Explainable AI

> **Hackathon Project** — Explainability & Ethics in AI  
> Version `2.1.0` | FastAPI + React + scikit-learn | Docker-ready

---

## 🎯 Objectives

CyberGuard AI is a **production-ready HR intelligence platform** that predicts employee attrition risk using **explainable machine learning**. The project explores the intersection of:

- **Explainable AI (XAI)** — every prediction comes with human-readable justifications
- **Fairness & Bias Auditing** — automatic detection of discriminatory patterns
- **GDPR & EU AI Act Compliance** — full transparency, human oversight, right to explanation
- **Cybersecurity** — secure-by-design API with audit logging and input sanitization

The goal is to demonstrate that AI can be **powerful AND responsible** — assisting HR teams without replacing human judgment.

## 🔭 Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
| Employee attrition risk prediction | Automated firing/hiring decisions |
| Explainability of model decisions | Real-time employee tracking |
| Counterfactual interventions | Biometric or surveillance data |
| Fairness audit by department/gender | External data sources |
| GDPR/AI Act compliance audit endpoints | Multi-company deployment |
| What-if simulation for HR decisions | |  

The system is designed as a **decision-support tool**: it informs HR professionals, never replaces them.

## 👤 Personas

### 1. 🧑‍💼 HR Manager — *Marie*
> "I need to know which employees are at risk of leaving and what I can do about it."

- Uses the **employee list** sorted by risk score
- Reads **counterfactual explanations**: "Increase salary 12% → risk drops from 73% to 48%"
- Runs **what-if simulations** before proposing a retention plan
- Accesses **RGPD audit** reports to stay compliant

### 2. 👩‍💻 Data Scientist — *Lucas*
> "I want to understand the model's behavior and check for hidden biases."

- Uses the **model explainability endpoint** to review feature importances
- Runs the **bias audit** to detect disparate impact across demographics
- Monitors **anomaly detection** for data quality issues
- Reviews correlation matrix to evaluate feature relevance

### 3. 🏢 HR Director — *Sophie*
> "I need to ensure our AI tools are fair, legal, and aligned with company values."

- Consults the **EU AI Act compliance audit** per employee
- Reviews **department-level attrition trends**
- Validates the **fairness report** before any HR decision
- Ensures employees' **right to explanation** is respected

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- OR: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+

### Option A — Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamferre-spec/Hackathon-Explainability-AI.git
cd Hackathon-Explainability-AI
docker compose up --build
```

- **Frontend** → http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API** → http://localhost:8000
- **Swagger Docs** → http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option B — Manual Setup

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📖 Instructions

### 1. Predict Employee Attrition

```bash
# Get risk score + explanation for employee #42
curl http://localhost:8000/api/hr/predict/42
```

Response includes: risk score, risk level (Low/Moderate/High/Critical), top risk factors, recommended action.

### 2. Run a What-If Simulation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/advanced/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emp_id": 42, "interventions": [{"type": "salary", "amount": 10}]}'
```

### 3. Audit for Bias

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/advanced/bias-audit
```

### 4. Check GDPR Compliance

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/hr/audit-rgpd/42
```

### 5. Full AI Act Compliance Audit

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/hr/ia-act/42
```
